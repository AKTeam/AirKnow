### AirKnow: An air quality app

When I first came to beijing, the most direct feeling about this city is "THE AIR, SUCKS". The thing is, even though I have already got myself prepared for this situation right before my arrival, but it still shocked me.   

After then, I figure out that I could use some air data from several air quality monitors around this city, to decide whether I wear a mask or not at the very beginning of a day.   

That's why this app was built, with simple and direct instructions.
